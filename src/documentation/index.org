* JNLP 
The Java Network Launch Protocol (JNLP) enables an application to be launched
on a client desktop by using resources that are hosted on a remote web
server. Java Plug-in software and Java Web Start software are considered JNLP
clients because they can launch remotely hosted applets and applications on a
client desktop.

** About
To begin with, the Molecular Workbench (MW) software is a special browser for
opening pages with embedded models and simulations (Not for HTML pages).

An MW page can have hyperlinks to other MW pages or web resources that have a
URL address. Visited pages are automatically cached for faster reloading and
offline use, and updated whenever there are new versions on the server where
they reside. A page can be bookmarked, or saved to the hard disk. The
conventional keyboard shortcuts can be used for similar functionalities.

Like a browser, MW can be used to open any MW page (created by MW's authoring
system) put on any HTTP web server. If you want to make models or create
activities and publish them on the Internet, you can be completely independent
of MW's developer (much like that you are independent of the companies that
produce your web browsers), as long as you have your own web space to upload
your stuff.



** My Analysis
   
   - Concept of launching a separate browser(JNLP) can be used to solve some of our
     other issues like having certain versions of Java and other software
     installed for the application to work properly.

   - Tools seem reasonable and they claim to be able to edit experiments
     too. So then it is possible that if we create basic components in other
     experiments people should be able to pull from those(not tested).

   - Quality of the experiments is quite high(at least the featured demos)

   - Need to determine complexity of authoring system(but prediction:
     complicated).

   - Well documented with instructions on how to create your own simulations.

   - Open Source, and its basic browser size is very small (1.2mb)

   - Probably very good for creating  Chemistry molecule related experiments as
     they have inbuilt features supporting the view for these things.
     

* DONE Google Web Components

- https://github.com/GoogleWebComponents

- Not of much use to this project in particular.


* DONE Dymola

https://www.3ds.com/products-services/catia/products/dymola/

** About
   
- A complete tool for modeling and simulation of integrated and complex systems
  for use within automotive, aerospace, robotics, process and other applications.


** Features

- Libraries in many different engineering domains are available
  that contain components for mechanical, electrical, control, thermal,
  pneumatic, hydraulic, power train, thermodynamics, vehicle dynamics, air
  -conditioning, etc.

- libraries include elements corresponding to physical devices which are simply
  dragged-and-dropped to build the model. Interactions between the components
  are conveniently described by graphical connections that model the physical
  coupling of the components.

- Source Code Generation exports code that can be used on any platform without
  the need of a Dymola license at the target system. A number of flags are
  available that can be used to modify the contents of the generated model
  code.


** My Analysis

- Seems like a very good tool for advanced modeling.

- Does not align with our current goals of creating simple lab authoring tools.

- Has potential to be integrated with in the future. The fact that the source
  code can be exported and edited with other tools as well is promising. 

- Can be used for very advanced modeling for very specific courses like
  vehicular technology
 
- Not Open Source

  animations with instanced objects.

- Good Time editor for high level animation edits

- Good Animation performance and rendering tools.

- 3D Modeling tools


** My Analysis

- For very high level modeling and animations

- Too complex for our use cases.

- Nothing said about possibility of creating libraries of objects, but should
  be possible.

- Has a free trial of 30 days (3years for students)

  application programming interface (API) for rendering 2D and 3D vector
  graphics.

** Features

** My Analysis

* DONE Rasmol

http://www.openrasmol.org/

** About 

- A computer program written for molecular graphics visualization intended and
  used mainly to depict and explore biological macromolecule structures, such
  as those found in the Protein Data Bank.


** Features 

- Visualization of proteins, nucleic acids and small molecules. The program is
  aimed at display, teaching and generation of publication quality images

- Runs on all common OS distributions.

- Reads molecule files and displays them


** My Analysis

- This could be looked at as a separate feature that could be implemented.

- There is an open source version which we could potentially integrate our site
  with to allow this reading and displaying of molecule files.

  
* DONE Bullet Phyiscs / ammo.js

http://bulletphysics.org/wordpress/

https://github.com/kripken/ammo.js/

** About

- Bullet is a physics engine which simulates collision detection, soft and
  rigid body dynamics. It has been used in video games as well as for visual
  effects in movies.


** Features

- Rigid body and soft body simulation with discrete and continuous collision
  detection

- Collision shapes include: sphere, box, cylinder, cone, convex hull using GJK,
  non-convex and triangle mesh


** My Analysis

- For much more advanced level modeling of collisions(used by NASA)

- Not required by us.

- Open Source

- Ammo js is interesting: converts bullet to javascript directly without human
  writing in between. The concepts could maybe be used in other converting
  labs.
  They use emscripten for the conversion.


* DONE KiCad

http://kicad-pcb.org/about/kicad/

** About

- KiCad is an open source software suite for Electronic Design Automation
  (EDA). The programs handle Schematic Capture, and PCB Layout with Gerber
  output.


** Features

- Used for designing complicated circuits.

- Professional tool, things made using it:
  http://kicad-pcb.org/made-with-kicad/


** My Analysis 

- We do not need to use something like this. It is for extremely professional
  creations which we do not aim to create.


* DONE Unreal Game Engine


https://www.unrealengine.com/en-US/blog

- May need to change the approach of experiments to help it fit within a game
  engine kind of model

- Need to see the possibility of creating a library of objects that are
  transportable across games / applications.


* DONE TryEngineering 

http://tryengineering.org/

** About

- Education Site with some games and tools.

- NOT for creating experiments but can be thought of as an alternate approach

* DONE Randy Pausch and Alice Programming Language

https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alice_(software)

** About

- Alice is a freeware (for non-commercial purposes) object-based educational
  programming language with an integrated development environment (IDE). Alice
  uses a drag and drop environment to create computer animations using 3D
  models.


** Features

- Alice is designed solely to teach programming theory without the complex
  semantics of production languages such as C++. Users can place objects from
  Alice's gallery into the virtual world that they have imagined, and then they
  can program by dragging and dropping tiles that represent logical structures.


** My Analysis

- A good educational tool that is worth looking into. Is not for our goal but
  can be used in other areas(to teach programming?)
