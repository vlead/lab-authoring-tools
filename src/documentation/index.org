* JNLP 
The Java Network Launch Protocol (JNLP) enables an application to be launched
on a client desktop by using resources that are hosted on a remote web
server. Java Plug-in software and Java Web Start software are considered JNLP
clients because they can launch remotely hosted applets and applications on a
client desktop.

** About
To begin with, the Molecular Workbench (MW) software is a special browser for
opening pages with embedded models and simulations (Not for HTML pages).

An MW page can have hyperlinks to other MW pages or web resources that have a
URL address. Visited pages are automatically cached for faster reloading and
offline use, and updated whenever there are new versions on the server where
they reside. A page can be bookmarked, or saved to the hard disk. The
conventional keyboard shortcuts can be used for similar functionalities.

Like a browser, MW can be used to open any MW page (created by MW's authoring
system) put on any HTTP web server. If you want to make models or create
activities and publish them on the Internet, you can be completely independent
of MW's developer (much like that you are independent of the companies that
produce your web browsers), as long as you have your own web space to upload
your stuff.



** My Analysis
   
   - Concept of launching a separate browser(JNLP) can be used to solve some of our
     other issues like having certain versions of Java and other software
     installed for the application to work properly.

   - Tools seem reasonable and they claim to be able to edit experiments
     too. So then it is possible that if we create basic components in other
     experiments people should be able to pull from those(not tested).

   - Quality of the experiments is quite high(at least the featured demos)

   - Need to determine complexity of authoring system(but prediction:
     complicated).

   - Well documented with instructions on how to create your own simulations.

   - Open Source, and its basic browser size is very small (1.2mb)

   - Probably very good for creating  Chemistry molecule related experiments as
     they have inbuilt features supporting the view for these things.

** About
   
- A complete tool for modeling and simulation of integrated and complex systems
  for use within automotive, aerospace, robotics, process and other applications.


** Features

- Libraries in many different engineering domains are available
  that contain components for mechanical, electrical, control, thermal,
  pneumatic, hydraulic, power train, thermodynamics, vehicle dynamics, air
  -conditioning, etc.

- libraries include elements corresponding to physical devices which are simply
  dragged-and-dropped to build the model. Interactions between the components
  are conveniently described by graphical connections that model the physical
  coupling of the components.

- Source Code Generation exports code that can be used on any platform without
  the need of a Dymola license at the target system. A number of flags are
  available that can be used to modify the contents of the generated model
  code.


** My Analysis

- Seems like a very good tool for advanced modeling.

- Does not align with our current goals of creating simple lab authoring tools.

- Has potential to be integrated with in the future. The fact that the source
  code can be exported and edited with other tools as well is promising. 

- Can be used for very advanced modeling for very specific courses like
  vehicular technology
 
- Not Open Source


* DONE SolidWorks

http://www.solidworks.in/

** About

- SOLIDWORKS solutions cover all aspects of your product development process
  with a seamless, integrated workflowâ€”design, verification, sustainable
  design, communication and data management. Designers and engineers can span
  multiple disciplines with ease, shortening the design cycle, increasing
  productivity and delivering innovative products to market faster.

** Features

- 3D CAD

- Simulation

- Product Data Management

- Electric Design and Modeling.

** My Analysis

- Cannot be used as a teaching tool or to develop teaching tools.

- Meant for professionals to create realistic models and simulations

- Should not be used even in the future for other modeling

- Not Open Source


* DONE Maya

https://www.autodesk.in/products/maya/overview

** About

-  3D animation, modelling, simulation and rendering software provides an
  integrated, powerful toolset. Use it for animation, environments, motion
  graphics, virtual reality and character creation.


** Features 

- Motion Graphics Toolset: Quickly create complex procedural effects and
  animations with instanced objects.

- Good Time editor for high level animation edits

- Good Animation performance and rendering tools.

- 3D Modeling tools


** My Analysis

- For very high level modeling and animations

- Too complex for our use cases.

- Nothing said about possibility of creating libraries of objects, but should
  be possible.

- Has a free trial of 30 days (3years for students)
