* Aim
  
- To create tools that will allow people to create lab experiments without
  coding.

- Making a library of objects(with their own features) to be used by experiment
  creators. 

** Studio

   - Create a simplistic studio where objects can be placed and given
     properties. They should react to the properties of frame when in display mode.


* Model (Of Thinking)

** Objects (Images)

   - List of objects needs to be classified and maintained.

   - Objects are JSON(or some standard format) and hold properties and their methods(actions)

   - Properties are exposed based on whether authoring mode or displaying mode.

   - Should be able to connect objects and properties should adjust as a result

   - Objects can be mass-produced in the future, but working samples need to be
     created first.


** Frame   

   - Frame is where the objects interact.

   - In a given frame objects can translate or rotate.

   - Frames are transitioned when an object appears/disappears (?)

   - Objects should inherit properties between frames
