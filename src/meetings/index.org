- Maybe raise issues on PHET repositories. Look through their work. In future cc Sir
  when reaching out to other organizations.

** Programming Model
- Programming model should be:

  - Objects with properties like mass, charge..etc (can be JSON objects)

  - Frame which can have field properties like gravity

  - When an object is placed in the field, based on it's properties it should
    react accordingly.

  - Should have the ability to connect objects(they have connection points),
    and sometimes properties should change accordingly(like when a connection
    completes a circuit).

- If model of approach is set, mass producing objects should not be a
  problem. Students would be given the image, and JSON format and would have to
  google and fill in the properties. 

- Prior to mass producing, few objects should be created and tested in the
  frames to know how they react.


** Conversion of Labs
- Potential for collaboration with other group: Flash to Javascript converters.

- Stats for them: takes approximately 1 person 1 week to create an
  experiment(given a video of it). More than 50% of time is spent on placing
  the objects on the screen(positioning), so a drag and place kind of system
  would save a LOT of time.

- We have someone who knows Java, could be useful in converting the remaining
  labs(which are in Java) to javascript. However it seems the principle of
  conversion remains the same and independent of the language in which the lab
  is originally written in.

- Need to also create a streamlined process for converting labs. My suggestion:
  have a video tutorial recorded to demonstrate a conversion and the tools
  required to ensure fast pickup by people to do this in the future.

** Meeting with Maruthi Sir
*** Oauth   
    - Discussed Model of Implementation and how to go about creating
      server-server flows.
    - Decided on using Google for user flow and separate auth server to
      implement client flow.
    - Decided that auth server will probably be black-boxed though the
      implementation of the flows will still need to be done.
    - Further implementation-wise clarifications.
*** Lab Authoring Tools
    - Many reference tools(documented).
    - discussed programming model for building.
    - importance of opengl/webgl
    - look for connecting different assets to a web browser via js or opengl
